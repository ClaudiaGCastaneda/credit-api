## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running on your local machine.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Execution

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name # Make sure you're in your project's root directory
    ```

2.  **Configure your application:**
    Ensure your `src/main/resources/application.properties` file is correctly configured to connect to your Docker database. Default Docker Compose values are usually aligned.

    Example key configurations:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    ```

3.  **Spin up the database and init application with Docker compose:**
 
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The application should start on `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port).

4.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**

5.  **Load Catalogs and Initial Data:**
    Once the application is running, open your browser or use a tool like Postman/cURL to hit the `seed` endpoint. This will load necessary catalogs (e.g., credit line rules, payment schemas, roles) into the database.
    ```
    POST http://localhost:8080/v1/seed
    ```
    You should see a success message in your browser or tool.
